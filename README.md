# IMDb_Sentiment_Analysis

# Introduction

This GitHub repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model. The goal is to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on its text content. The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries and tools. This README file will guide you through the code and its usage.

# Installation

Before using the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following commands:

!pip install datasets==2.13.1
!pip install spacy==3.6.1
!pip install torch==2.0.1    # Make sure you are using the same version
!pip install torchtext==0.15.2
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Code Overview

The code performs the following tasks:

1. Data Loading:

IMDb dataset is loaded using the datasets library.
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. Tokenization and Vocabulary Building:

Text data is tokenized using SpaCy.
A vocabulary is constructed from the training data with a specified vocabulary size.

3. Data Preprocessing:

Sequences are indexed using the vocabulary.
Custom dataset classes are created for PyTorch data loading.

4. Model Architecture:

A Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model is defined for sentiment analysis.
The model consists of embedding layers, LSTM layers, and fully connected layers for classification.

5. Training and Evaluation:

The code provides functionality for training and evaluating the model.
Multiple hyperparameter configurations are tested, and the best model is saved.
Training and evaluation metrics (loss, accuracy, F1 score) are logged in a CSV file.

6. Visualization:

The code includes visualization of training and evaluation metrics for different hyperparameter configurations.

# Usage

To use the code for IMDb sentiment analysis, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have installed the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Installation" section.

2. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine and navigate to the repository directory.

3. Run the code by executing the Python script.

python your_script_name.py

1. After running the code, it will train multiple models with different hyperparameter configurations and save the best model.

2. You can visualize the training and evaluation metrics by examining the plots generated by the code.

# Customization

If you want to customize the code for your specific needs, you can do the following:

* Modify hyperparameters and configurations in the configs dictionary to experiment with different settings.
* Adjust the model architecture in the BiLSTM class to fit your requirements.
* Change the optimization algorithm by setting the op parameter in the main function.
